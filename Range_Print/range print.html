<!--
GOAL:

Create a function that can take a start point, end point, and skip amount, to print all numbers in the range.

(Should go UP TO, but NOT INCLUDING the end point)

Bonus (Only If You Have Time):

Make sure it works for negative numbers
If the user doesn't pass a skip amount, make it default to 1 (printRange(4, 8); would print 4, 5, 6, 7)
If the user doesn't pass an end point, make it start at 0, and end at the first (printRange(4); would print 0, 1, 2, 3)
