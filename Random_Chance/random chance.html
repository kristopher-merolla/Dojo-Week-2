<!--
GOAL

Make a function that takes a number of quarters (1 quarter = 1 game).

There is a 1 in 100 chance to win the slot machine (which will give you between 50 - 100 quarters - use Math.random and Math.floor to pick a random number of coins).

While the user still has quarters, use Math.random to determine if they won.

If they ever win, return the number of quarters (ex: they had 50 remaining quarters and won 90, so it should return 140).

Return 0 if all the quarters were wasted.
